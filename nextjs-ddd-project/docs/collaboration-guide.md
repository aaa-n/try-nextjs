# Collaboration Guide: Parallel Feature Development

This guide outlines how Team A (Product Management) and Team B (User Management) will collaborate effectively while developing features in parallel.

## Team Structure and Responsibilities

### Team A: Product Management
- **Frontend Developer**: Responsible for product UI components and pages
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for product domain, application, and infrastructure layers

### Team B: User Management
- **Frontend Developer**: Responsible for user UI components and pages
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for user domain, application, and infrastructure layers

### QA Engineer
- Works across both teams
- Responsible for testing both features and their integration

## Communication Channels

- **Daily Standup**: 15-minute meeting with all team members
- **Slack Channels**:
  - `#team-product`: Team A discussions
  - `#team-user`: Team B discussions
  - `#project-general`: Cross-team discussions
  - `#technical-issues`: Technical problem-solving
- **Weekly Sync Meeting**: 1-hour meeting to discuss integration points and resolve blockers

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

1. **Main Branch**: `main` - Always contains stable code
2. **Feature Branches**:
   - Team A: `feature/product-*`
   - Team B: `feature/user-*`
3. **Integration Branch**: `develop` - For testing feature integration

#### Branch Creation Process
```bash
# For Team A
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/product-listing

# For Team B
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

#### Pull Request Process
1. Create PR to `develop` branch
2. Require code review from at least one team member
3. Pass all automated tests
4. Resolve any merge conflicts
5. Merge to `develop`

### Code Review Guidelines

1. Review code within 24 hours of PR submission
2. Focus on:
   - Adherence to DDD principles
   - Code quality and readability
   - Test coverage
   - Performance considerations
3. Use constructive feedback
4. Resolve all comments before merging

## Integration Points

### Shared Code

Both teams will need to coordinate when working on:

1. **Shared Types**: Entity, ValueObject, DomainEvent interfaces
2. **Shared UI Components**: Layout, Navigation, Forms
3. **Authentication Context**: Used by both features
4. **Event Bus**: For cross-domain communication

### Integration Schedule

- **End of Week 1**: Integrate domain models
- **End of Week 2**: Integrate application services
- **End of Week 3**: Integrate UI components
- **End of Week 4**: Full feature integration

## Dependency Management

### Shared Dependencies

- Both teams should coordinate when updating shared dependencies
- Use package.json for tracking dependencies
- Document any new dependencies in the PR description

### Version Control

- Lock file (package-lock.json) should be committed
- Major dependency updates require discussion in weekly sync meeting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Each team is responsible for unit tests in their domain
- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Run tests before creating PRs

### Integration Testing

- QA Engineer will create integration tests
- Both teams should review integration tests
- Integration tests run on the `develop` branch

### End-to-End Testing

- QA Engineer will create E2E tests
- Both teams should provide input on test scenarios
- E2E tests run on the `develop` branch

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex business logic
- Update README.md with new features

### Architecture Documentation

- Update architecture diagrams when making significant changes
- Document integration points between features
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Conflicts

1. Discuss in the appropriate Slack channel
2. If unresolved, escalate to weekly sync meeting
3. Technical lead makes final decision if consensus can't be reached

### Priority Conflicts

1. Refer to the project plan for priorities
2. Discuss impact of changes with both teams
3. Update the project plan if necessary

## Performance Considerations

### Code Reviews

- Review for performance issues:
  - Unnecessary re-renders
  - Inefficient database queries
  - Large bundle sizes

### Monitoring

- Set up performance monitoring
- Track key metrics:
  - Page load time
  - API response time
  - Database query time

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- Team B will implement the core authentication system
- Team A will consume the authentication context
- Both teams should follow security best practices:
  - Input validation
  - Output encoding
  - CSRF protection
  - XSS prevention

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data should be properly encrypted
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Implement proper access controls

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments

- **Development**: For individual feature testing
- **Integration**: For testing feature integration
- **Staging**: For pre-production testing
- **Production**: For end users

### Deployment Process

1. Merge to `develop` branch
2. Automated tests run
3. Deploy to integration environment
4. QA testing
5. Merge to `main` branch
6. Deploy to staging environment
7. Final QA approval
8. Deploy to production

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts

1. Pull latest changes from the target branch
2. Resolve conflicts locally
3. Run tests to ensure everything works
4. Push changes

### Build Failures

1. Check the build logs
2. Fix issues locally
3. Verify build succeeds locally
4. Push changes

### Integration Issues

1. Identify the source of the issue
2. Coordinate with the other team if necessary
3. Fix the issue in the appropriate codebase
4. Verify the fix in the integration environment

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Measured by linting, test coverage, and code reviews
- **Feature Completeness**: All requirements implemented
- **Integration Success**: Features work together seamlessly
- **Performance**: Meets performance benchmarks
- **User Experience**: Positive feedback from usability testing

## Conclusion

By following this collaboration guide, both teams can work effectively in parallel while ensuring their features integrate seamlessly. Regular communication, clear responsibilities, and a structured workflow will help prevent conflicts and ensure a successful project outcome.
