# Team Collaboration Simulation Scenarios

This document outlines simulation scenarios for a team of 5 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend, 1 QA) collaborating on the Next.js DDD project. These scenarios demonstrate how the architecture supports multi-developer collaboration.

### Frontend Developer 1: UI Components

**Tasks**:
1. Create atomic components for reviews (Rating stars, ReviewCard, ReviewForm)
2. Implement the ReviewList organism
3. Create hooks for review data fetching and submission

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/ui/components/atoms/RatingStars.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/molecules/ReviewCard.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/organisms/ReviewList.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/organisms/ReviewForm.tsx`
- `src/ui/hooks/useReviews.ts`

### Frontend Developer 2: Page Integration

**Tasks**:
1. Update the product detail page to include reviews
2. Create a "Write Review" page
3. Implement client-side validation
4. Add loading and error states

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/app/(shop)/products/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(shop)/products/[id]/reviews/new/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(shop)/products/[id]/reviews/page.tsx`

### QA Engineer: Testing

**Tasks**:
1. Create test plans and test cases for the Reviews feature
2. Write unit tests for the Review entity and ReviewService
3. Implement integration tests for the review API endpoints
4. Create E2E tests for the complete review flow
5. Perform manual testing across different browsers and devices

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `tests/unit/domain/entities/Review.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/application/ReviewService.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/api/reviews.test.ts`
- `tests/e2e/reviews.spec.ts`

## Scenario 2: Fixing a Bug - Product Filtering

### Bug Report

**Description**: Product filtering by category doesn't work correctly when multiple filters are applied.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Go to the products page
2. Select category "Electronics"
3. Select price range "$100-$500"
4. Products from other categories are still showing up

### QA Engineer: Bug Verification

**Tasks**:
1. Verify the bug and document exact steps to reproduce
2. Identify which components and services are involved
3. Create a test case that reproduces the bug
4. Assign the bug to the appropriate team members

### Backend Developer 1: Investigating Domain Logic

**Tasks**:
1. Debug the ProductService filtering logic
2. Fix the issue in the domain or application layer
3. Add unit tests to verify the fix
4. Update the repository implementation if needed

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/core/application/use-cases/ProductService.ts`
- `tests/unit/application/ProductService.test.ts`

### Frontend Developer 1: UI Verification

**Tasks**:
1. Verify that the UI is correctly sending filter parameters
2. Update the filter component if needed
3. Add error handling for filter edge cases

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/ui/components/organisms/ProductFilter.tsx`
- `src/ui/hooks/useProductFilters.ts`

### QA Engineer: Testing the Fix

**Tasks**:
1. Verify the bug fix in the development environment
2. Run regression tests to ensure nothing else broke
3. Update test cases if needed

## Scenario 3: Performance Optimization

### Performance Issue

**Description**: The product listing page is slow to load when there are many products.

### Backend Developer 2: API Optimization

**Tasks**:
1. Implement pagination for the products API
2. Add caching for product data
3. Optimize database queries

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/core/application/use-cases/ProductService.ts`
- `src/infrastructure/repositories/ApiProductRepository.ts`
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts`

### Frontend Developer 2: UI Optimization

**Tasks**:
1. Implement virtual scrolling or pagination in the UI
2. Add loading indicators
3. Implement client-side caching

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/ui/components/organisms/ProductList.tsx`
- `src/app/(shop)/products/page.tsx`
- `src/ui/hooks/useProducts.ts`

### QA Engineer: Performance Testing

**Tasks**:
1. Measure page load times before and after optimization
2. Test with different numbers of products
3. Verify that pagination works correctly
4. Test across different devices and network conditions

## Collaboration Touchpoints

Throughout these scenarios, the team collaborates at several key touchpoints:

1. **Daily Standups**: Team members share progress, blockers, and plans
2. **Code Reviews**: Developers review each other's code before merging
3. **Pair Programming**: Frontend and backend developers pair on integration points
4. **API Contract Discussions**: Frontend and backend developers agree on API contracts
5. **Bug Triage**: QA and developers discuss bug severity and assignment
6. **Demo Sessions**: Team demonstrates completed features to stakeholders

## Benefits of the DDD Architecture for Collaboration

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each developer can work on their part without stepping on others' toes
2. **Well-Defined Interfaces**: API contracts and DTOs provide clear communication points
3. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, application logic, and domain logic are separated
4. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
5. **Domain Focus**: The shared domain model provides a common language for the team
