# Team Collaboration Workshop Guide

## Overview

This workshop is designed to demonstrate how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture principles in Next.js 15 support multi-developer collaboration. The workshop simulates a team of 5 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend, 1 QA) working together on a shared project.

## Workshop Objectives

1. Understand how DDD principles facilitate team collaboration
2. Experience how clean architecture creates clear boundaries between different concerns
3. Learn how to organize a Next.js project for multi-developer collaboration
4. Practice communication and coordination between different roles
5. Identify potential challenges and solutions in team collaboration

## Workshop Materials

This workshop includes the following materials:

1. **Project Structure**: A Next.js 15 project organized according to DDD principles
2. **Role-Specific Guides**: Documentation for each role (frontend, backend, QA)
3. **Simulation Scenarios**: Scenarios that demonstrate team collaboration
4. **Simulated Use Cases**: Detailed examples of how each role would work on a specific task
5. **Workshop Exercises**: Hands-on exercises for participants

## Workshop Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React and Next.js

### Repository Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-ddd-project.git
cd nextjs-ddd-project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Workshop Format

This workshop can be conducted in various formats:

1. **Full-Day Workshop**: Complete all exercises and scenarios
2. **Half-Day Workshop**: Focus on key scenarios and exercises
3. **Multi-Day Workshop**: Spread exercises across multiple sessions
4. **Self-Paced Learning**: Participants work through materials at their own pace

## Workshop Flow

### 1. Introduction (30 minutes)

- Welcome and overview of the workshop
- Introduction to DDD and clean architecture principles
- Explanation of the project structure
- Overview of the roles and responsibilities

### 2. Role Assignment (15 minutes)

- Assign participants to roles:
  - Frontend Developer 1: UI Component Specialist
  - Frontend Developer 2: Page and Integration Specialist
  - Backend Developer 1: Domain Modeling Specialist
  - Backend Developer 2: Application Services and Infrastructure Specialist
  - QA Engineer: Quality Assurance Specialist

- If there are more than 5 participants, create multiple teams or have participants share roles

### 3. Role Exploration (45 minutes)

- Participants read their role-specific guides
- Explore the codebase from their role's perspective
- Identify key files and components relevant to their role
- Prepare questions for clarification

### 4. Scenario Walkthrough (60 minutes)

- Walk through Scenario 1: Adding a New Feature - Product Reviews
- Discuss how each role contributes to the feature
- Highlight collaboration points between roles
- Identify potential challenges and solutions

### 5. Simulated Use Case Exercise (90 minutes)

- Participants review the simulated use case for their role
- Implement a simplified version of the task described in their use case
- Coordinate with other roles as needed
- Document their experience and challenges

### 6. New Feature Implementation (120 minutes)

- As a team, implement a new feature (e.g., Product Filtering)
- Each role contributes according to their responsibilities
- Practice communication and coordination
- Document the implementation process

### 7. Reflection and Discussion (45 minutes)

- Share experiences and challenges
- Discuss what worked well and what could be improved
- Identify best practices for team collaboration
- Provide feedback on the project structure and architecture

### 8. Conclusion (15 minutes)

- Summarize key learnings
- Provide resources for further learning
- Answer any remaining questions
- Collect feedback on the workshop

## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Role Exploration

**Objective**: Understand your role's responsibilities and relevant parts of the codebase.

**Tasks**:
1. Read your role-specific guide
2. Identify 5 key files or components relevant to your role
3. Document how these files/components relate to DDD principles
4. Prepare 3 questions about your role or the codebase

### Exercise 2: Simulated Use Case Implementation

**Objective**: Implement a simplified version of the task described in your role's simulated use case.

**Tasks**:
1. Review your simulated use case
2. Identify the core functionality to implement
3. Create or modify the necessary files
4. Coordinate with other roles as needed
5. Document your implementation process

### Exercise 3: New Feature Implementation - Product Filtering

**Objective**: Work as a team to implement a new feature.

**Feature Requirements**:
- Users can filter products by category, price range, and availability
- Filters are applied on the client side without page reload
- Filter state is reflected in the URL for sharing and bookmarking
- The UI shows active filters and allows clearing individual filters

**Tasks by Role**:

**Frontend Developer 1**:
- Create filter UI components (checkboxes, sliders, etc.)
- Implement filter state management

**Frontend Developer 2**:
- Integrate filter components into the products page
- Implement URL synchronization

**Backend Developer 1**:
- Define filter-related domain models and interfaces
- Update the Product entity if needed

**Backend Developer 2**:
- Implement filter-related application services
- Update API endpoints to support filtering

**QA Engineer**:
- Create test cases for the filtering feature
- Test the implementation across different scenarios

### Exercise 4: Bug Fix Collaboration

**Objective**: Experience how the team collaborates to fix a bug.

**Bug Scenario**:
- When a user submits a review, the success message appears but the new review is not displayed until the page is refreshed

**Tasks**:
1. QA Engineer creates a detailed bug report
2. Team discusses the potential causes
3. Identify which roles need to be involved in the fix
4. Implement and test the fix
5. Document the collaboration process

## Facilitation Tips

1. **Preparation**: Ensure all participants have the repository set up before the workshop
2. **Time Management**: Be flexible with time allocations based on the group's progress
3. **Support**: Have additional facilitators available to help participants with technical issues
4. **Documentation**: Encourage participants to document their experiences and challenges
5. **Reflection**: Allow time for reflection after each exercise
6. **Adaptation**: Adjust exercises based on the participants' experience level

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants should:

1. Understand how DDD principles support team collaboration
2. Be familiar with the project structure and architecture
3. Experience the benefits of clear boundaries between different concerns
4. Practice communication and coordination between different roles
5. Identify best practices for multi-developer collaboration
