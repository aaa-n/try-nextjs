# Team Collaboration with DDD and Next.js 15

This directory contains materials for simulating team collaboration in a Next.js 15 project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and clean architecture. These materials are designed for team collaboration workshops and training sessions.

## Overview

The simulation demonstrates how a team of 5 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend, 1 QA) can collaborate effectively on a shared project using DDD principles and clean architecture. The materials include role-specific guides, simulation scenarios, and detailed use cases for each role.

## Team Roles

### Frontend Developer 1: UI Component Specialist

Responsible for creating reusable UI components following atomic design principles. This role focuses on building the core UI library that other developers will use throughout the application.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Building UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Implementing component styling and interactions
- Creating reusable hooks for component logic
- Ensuring component accessibility and responsiveness

### Frontend Developer 2: Page and Integration Specialist

Responsible for building pages and integrating UI components with backend services. This role focuses on creating complete user experiences by combining components and connecting them to data sources.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating page layouts and routes
- Integrating UI components into pages
- Implementing data fetching and state management
- Handling client-side navigation and routing

### Backend Developer 1: Domain Modeling Specialist

Responsible for domain modeling and core business logic. This role focuses on creating robust domain entities, value objects, and repository interfaces that accurately represent the business domain.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Defining domain entities and value objects
- Implementing business rules and validation
- Creating repository interfaces
- Designing domain events and services

### Backend Developer 2: Application Services and Infrastructure Specialist

Responsible for implementing application services and infrastructure components. This role focuses on creating the bridge between the domain model and the outside world, including API routes, repositories, and external service integrations.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Implementing application services and use cases
- Creating repository implementations
- Building API routes and controllers
- Integrating with external services

### QA Engineer: Quality Assurance Specialist

Responsible for ensuring the quality of the application through comprehensive testing. This role focuses on verifying that the application meets requirements, identifying bugs, and providing feedback to the development team.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating test plans and test cases
- Implementing automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performing manual testing
- Reporting bugs and verifying fixes

## Simulation Scenarios

The simulation includes several scenarios that demonstrate how the team collaborates on different tasks:

1. **Adding a New Feature**: The team works together to implement a new Product Reviews feature
2. **Fixing a Bug**: The team collaborates to fix a bug in the Product Filtering functionality
3. **Performance Optimization**: The team optimizes the performance of the product listing page

Each scenario highlights the responsibilities of each role and the collaboration points between them.

## Simulated Use Cases

The simulated use cases provide detailed examples of how each role would work on a specific task. These use cases include:

- Code examples
- Step-by-step workflows
- Collaboration touchpoints
- Challenges and solutions

## How to Use These Materials

These materials can be used in various ways:

1. **Team Training**: Use the workshop guide to conduct a team training session
2. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand their role and responsibilities
3. **Process Improvement**: Identify areas for improvement in your team's collaboration
4. **Architecture Design**: Learn how to structure a Next.js project for multi-developer collaboration

## Benefits of DDD for Team Collaboration

Domain-Driven Design provides several benefits for team collaboration:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: A shared language between developers and domain experts
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined boundaries between different parts of the application
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Scalability**: The architecture supports adding new features without affecting existing functionality

## Getting Started

1. Read the workshop guide to understand the overall approach
2. Review the role-specific guide for your role
3. Explore the simulated use case for your role
4. Participate in the simulation scenarios with your team

## Conclusion

This simulation demonstrates how Domain-Driven Design principles and clean architecture support multi-developer collaboration in a Next.js 15 project. By following these principles, teams can work together more effectively, reduce integration issues, and build more maintainable applications.
