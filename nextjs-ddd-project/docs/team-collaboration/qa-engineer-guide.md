# QA Engineer Guide

## Role Overview

As a QA Engineer on the Next.js DDD project, you are responsible for:

1. Ensuring the quality of the application through comprehensive testing
2. Creating and executing test plans and test cases
3. Identifying and reporting bugs and issues
4. Verifying that the application meets requirements and acceptance criteria
5. Collaborating with frontend and backend developers to improve quality

```

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing

- Verify that individual components and functions work correctly
- Focus on domain entities, value objects, and application services
- Ensure business rules are correctly implemented
- Use Jest for unit testing

### 2. Integration Testing

- Test the interaction between different parts of the application
- Verify that repositories correctly interact with the database
- Test API routes with their corresponding application services
- Use Jest and Supertest for API testing

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- Test the application from the user's perspective
- Verify complete user flows and scenarios
- Ensure the UI correctly interacts with the backend
- Use Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing

### 4. Manual Testing

- Perform exploratory testing to find edge cases
- Verify visual aspects and user experience
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Validate accessibility requirements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Test Planning

1. Review requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Identify test scenarios and test cases
3. Create a test plan document
4. Define test data requirements

### 2. Test Implementation

1. Write automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
2. Create test scripts for manual testing
3. Set up test environments and data
4. Implement test utilities and helpers

### 3. Test Execution

1. Run automated tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
2. Execute manual test cases
3. Report and track bugs and issues
4. Verify bug fixes

### 4. Test Reporting

1. Generate test reports
2. Communicate test results to the team
3. Provide feedback on quality and risks
4. Suggest improvements to the testing process

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Working with Frontend Developers

1. **Requirements Clarification**: Help clarify UI requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Component Testing**: Provide feedback on component testability
3. **UI Bugs**: Report UI bugs with clear steps to reproduce and screenshots
4. **User Flows**: Validate complete user flows and interactions

### Working with Backend Developers

1. **API Testing**: Test API endpoints for correctness and error handling
2. **Data Validation**: Verify data validation rules are correctly implemented
3. **Business Rules**: Ensure business rules are properly enforced
4. **Performance**: Test API performance and response times

## Example: Testing a New Feature

Let's say we need to test the "Product Reviews" feature:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test Review entity validation rules
   - Test ReviewService methods
   - Verify rating calculations

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test ReviewRepository with a test database
   - Test API routes for creating and fetching reviews
   - Verify error handling and edge cases

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test the complete flow of viewing and adding reviews
   - Verify UI components display reviews correctly
   - Test form validation and submission

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test across different browsers and devices
   - Verify visual aspects and user experience
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Test Pyramid**: Follow the test pyramid approach (more unit tests, fewer E2E tests)
2. **Test Independence**: Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on each other
3. **Test Data**: Use consistent test data and clean up after tests
4. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
5. **Bug Reporting**: Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results
6. **Test Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date test documentation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Focusing only on happy path scenarios
2. Neglecting edge cases and error scenarios
3. Writing brittle E2E tests that break with minor UI changes
4. Insufficient test coverage for critical business logic
5. Manual testing without proper documentation
6. Not verifying bug fixes thoroughly

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or have questions:
1. Review the requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Discuss with developers to understand implementation details
3. Consult with the tech lead for guidance on testing approach
4. Check existing test implementations for similar features
