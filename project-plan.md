# Next.js 15 Project Plan with DDD and Clean Architecture

## Project Overview
This plan outlines the structure and implementation of a Next.js 15 project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and clean architecture. The project is designed to support multi-developer collaboration with clear boundaries, modular components, and well-defined interfaces.

## Goals
- Create a scalable, maintainable application architecture
- Support multi-developer collaboration with clear boundaries
- Implement DDD principles for better domain modeling
- Ensure code quality and consistency across the codebase
- Enable parallel development of features

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Domain Modeling**: Define entities, value objects, and domain services
2. **Application Layer**: Implement use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implement repositories and external services
4. **UI Layer**: Develop UI components and pages
5. **Integration**: Connect all layers and test the feature

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Each feature should be developed in a separate branch
- Use Pull Requests for code reviews
- Write unit tests for domain and application layers
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Follow the established coding standards

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Server Components for server-rendered UI
- Server Actions for mutations

### State Management
- React Context for local state
- Redux Toolkit for complex global state (optional)
- React Query for server state management

### Testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- TypeScript for static type checking

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky
- Configure directory structure
- Set up testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- Implement core domain models
- Set up repository interfaces
- Create application services
- Configure database connections

### Phase 3: Feature Development
- Implement authentication feature
- Develop product management feature
- Create user management feature
- Build dashboard feature

### Phase 4: UI Development
- Develop shared UI components
- Implement page layouts
- Create responsive designs
- Build interactive elements

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
- Write unit tests for all layers
- Perform integration testing
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy to production

## Best Practices

### Domain-Driven Design
- Use ubiquitous language throughout the codebase
- Define clear bounded contexts
- Implement entities with identity and value objects
- Use domain events for cross-boundary communication

### Clean Architecture
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers
- Ensure dependencies point inward
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Keep domain logic pure and free from infrastructure concerns

### Code Organization
- Group code by feature and layer
- Use barrel exports for cleaner imports
- Keep components small and focused
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle

### Performance
- Leverage React Server Components for better performance
- Implement proper data fetching strategies
- Use partial prerendering for dynamic content
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

## Conclusion
This plan provides a comprehensive approach to building a Next.js 15 application using DDD principles and clean architecture. By following this structure, teams can collaborate effectively, maintain code quality, and deliver a scalable, maintainable application.
